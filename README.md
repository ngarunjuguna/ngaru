# hi there 

my name is Ngaru, and I`m a telecommunication engineer interested in Python and data science!
  im currently working on a Python code that demonstrates how to collect car wash sales data, store it, and then display the total sales for each day or type of service. In this example, we'll simulate car wash sales using a dictionary and then use pandas for data storage and analysis, and  expand it to collect data from a real-time system or database.
